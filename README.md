# Steamy: Your Personalized Gaming Dashboard
Steamy is a comprehensive gaming dashboard designed to enhance your gaming experience by seamlessly integrating with the Steam Web API and the RAWG Video Game Database API.

With Steamy, users can effortlessly log in using their Steam account credentials and gain access to their game library, achievements, and friends list. The application further enriches the user experience by providing in-depth information about each game, including detailed descriptions, captivating screenshots, and insightful user reviews, all fetched in real-time from the RAWG API.

A standout feature of Steamy is the ability to create personalized notes for each game. This functionality empowers users to record crucial game strategies, memorable gaming experiences, or any game-related information. These notes are securely stored in a SQL Server database, offering users the flexibility to view or modify them at their convenience.

Steamy is engineered using cutting-edge technologies, including ASP.NET Core for the robust backend and Angular for the dynamic frontend. The application leverages Entity Framework Core for efficient data access and Identity for secure user management. With a strong emphasis on security and performance, Steamy implements JWT authentication and optimizes API calls to ensure a smooth user experience.

Developing Steamy has been an enriching journey, allowing me to delve deeper into web development and work with intriguing APIs. The challenge of integrating with the Steam and RAWG APIs and crafting a user-friendly interface for gamers has been rewarding. I take immense pride in the strides I've made with Steamy and look forward to continually refining and expanding the application to cater to the evolving needs of gamers.
